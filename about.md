## Hey there!
I've been designing apps, websites, and games for 4+ years and enjoy anything to do with computers.
I collaborate mostly on complex Java projects and bits of C/C++ projects, but I occasionally dabble
in graphics arts, web design, UI/UX, and Android development.

By day, I am a cashier working the swing shift and by night I am a programmer writing code for
any problem that comes to mind.

When I'm not found glued to my computer, I can be found enjoying other hobbies, spending time
with my family, listening to music or planning out new ideas and things for me to try.

I'm currently accepting new projects, so if you're in need of something specific, feel free to [drop an email](mailto:jacobharris5705@gmail.com).
